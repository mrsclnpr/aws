                    capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.<br><br> 
                    The simple web interface of Amazon EC2 allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal
                    friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s
                    proven computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server
                    instances (called Amazon EC2 instances) to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and
                    down, as your computing requirements change. <br><br> Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by
                    allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use. Amazon EC2 provides developers and system
                    administrators the tools to build failure resilient applications and isolate themselves from common
                  failure scenarios.</p>

                <div class="modal-body">
                  <p>Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading
                    scalability, data availability, security, and performance. This means customers of all sizes and industries
                    can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as websites, mobile
                    applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics.
                    Amazon S3 provides easy-to-use management features so you can organize your data and configure
                    finely-tuned access controls to meet your specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.
                    Amazon S3 is designed for 99.999999999% (11 9s) of durability, and stores data for millions of
                    applications for companies all around the world. <br><br>
                    Amazon S3 storage classes are a range of storage classes that you can choose from based on the data
                    access, resiliency, and cost requirements of your workloads. S3 storage classes are purpose-built to
                    provide the lowest cost storage for different access patterns. S3 storage classes are ideal for virtually any
                    use case, including those with demanding performance needs, data residency requirements, unknown or
                    changing access patterns, or archival storage.
                    The S3 storage classes include:
                    <li> S3 Intelligent-Tiering for automatic cost savings for data with unknown or changing access patterns</li>
                    <li> S3 Standard for frequently accessed data</li>
                    <li> S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) and S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One ZoneIA) for less frequently accessed data</li>
                    <li> S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval for archive data that needs immediate access</li>
                    <li> S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly S3 Glacier) for rarely accessed long-term data that does not</li>
                    require immediate access
                    <li> Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive (S3 Glacier Deep Archive) for long-term archive and digital
                    preservation with retrieval in hours at the lowest cost storage in the cloud</li> <br>
                    If you have data residency requirements that can’t be met by an existing AWS Region, you can use the S3
                    Outposts storage class to store your S3 data on premises. Amazon S3 also offers capabilities to manage
                    your data throughout its lifecycle. Once an S3 Lifecycle policy is set, your data will automatically transfer
                    to a different storage class without any changes to your application.

                    open source databases. <br><br>
                    Amazon Aurora is up to five times faster than standard MySQL databases and three times faster than
                    standard PostgreSQL databases. It provides the security, availability, and reliability of commercial
                    databases at 1/10th the cost. Amazon Aurora is fully managed by Amazon Relational Database Service
                    (Amazon RDS), which automates time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning,
                    database setup, patching, and backups.<br><br>
                    Amazon Aurora features a distributed, fault-tolerant, self-healing storage system that auto-scales up
                    to 128TB per database instance. It delivers high performance and availability with up to 15 low-latency
                    read replicas, point-in-time recovery, continuous backup to Amazon S3, and replication across three
                  Availability Zones (AZs).</p>

                  <p>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. <br><br> You can use both IPv4 and IPv6 in your VPC for secure and easy access to resources and applications. You can easily customize the network configuration for your VPC. For example, you can create a publicfacing subnet for your web servers that has access to the Internet, and place your backend systems, such as databases or application servers, in a private-facing subnet with no Internet access. You can leverage multiple layers of security (including security groups and network access control lists) to help control access to EC2 instances in each subnet. <br><br> Additionally, you can create a hardware virtual private network (VPN) connection between your corporate data center and your VPC and leverage the AWS Cloud as an extension of your corporate data center.</p>

                  <p>AWS Lake Formation is a service that makes it easy to set up a secure data lake in days. A data lake is a centralized, curated, and secured repository that stores all your data, both in its original form and prepared for analysis. A data lake enables you to break down data silos and combine different types of analytics to gain insights and guide better business decisions. <br><br> However, setting up and managing data lakes today involves a lot of manual, complicated, and timeconsuming tasks. This work includes loading data from diverse sources, monitoring those data flows, setting up partitions, turning on encryption and managing keys, defining transformation jobs and monitoring their operation, re-organizing data into a columnar format, configuring access control settings, deduplicating redundant data, matching linked records, granting access to data sets, and auditing access over time. <br><br> Creating a data lake with Lake Formation is as simple as defining where your data resides and what data access and security policies you want to apply. Lake Formation then collects and catalogs data from databases and object storage, moves the data into your new Amazon S3 data lake, cleans and classifies data using ML algorithms, and secures access to your sensitive data. Your users can then access a centralized catalog of data which describes available data sets and their appropriate usage. Your users then leverage these data sets with their choice of analytics and ML services, such as Amazon EMR for Apache Spark, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Athena, SageMaker, and Amazon QuickSight.</p>

Standard queues offer maximum throughput, besteffort ordering, and at-least-once delivery. Amazon SQS FIFO queues are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent.</p>

                  <p>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute
                    capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.<br><br> 
                    The simple web interface of Amazon EC2 allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal
                    friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s
                    proven computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server
                    instances (called Amazon EC2 instances) to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and
                    down, as your computing requirements change. <br><br> Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by
                    allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use. Amazon EC2 provides developers and system
                    administrators the tools to build failure resilient applications and isolate themselves from common
                  failure scenarios.</p>

                  <p>AWS Fargate is a compute engine for Amazon ECS that allows you to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters. With AWS Fargate, you no longer have to provision, configure, and scale clusters of VMs to run containers. This removes the need to choose server types, decide when to scale your clusters, or optimize cluster packing. Fargate removes the need for you to interact with or think about servers or clusters. Fargate lets you focus on designing and building your applications instead of managing the infrastructure that runs them. <br><br>Amazon ECS has two modes: Fargate launch type and EC2 launch type. With Fargate launch type, all you have to do is package your application in containers, specify the CPU and memory requirements, define networking and IAM policies, and launch the application. EC2 launch type allows you to have server-level, more granular control over the infrastructure that runs your container applications. With EC2 launch type, you can use Amazon ECS to manage a cluster of servers and schedule placement of containers on the servers. Amazon ECS keeps track of all the CPU, memory and other resources in your cluster, and also finds the best server for a container to run on based on your specified resource requirements. <br><br>You are responsible for provisioning, patching, and scaling clusters of servers. You can decide which type of server to use, which applications and how many containers to run in a cluster to optimize utilization, and when you should add or remove servers from a cluster. EC2 launch type gives you more control of your server clusters and provides a broader range of customization options, which might be required to support some specific applications or possible compliance and government requirements.</p>

                  <p>Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale an in-memory
                  cache in the cloud. The service improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve
                  information from fast, managed, in-memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based
                  databases. Amazon ElastiCache supports two open-source in-memory caching engines:
                  <li>Redis - a fast, open-source, in-memory key-value data store for use as a database, cache, message
                  broker, and queue. Amazon ElastiCache for Redis is a Redis-compatible in-memory service that delivers
                  the ease-of-use and power of Redis along with the availability, reliability, and performance suitable for
                  the most demanding applications. Both single-node and up to 15-shard clusters are available, enabling
                  scalability to up to 3.55 TiB of in-memory data. Amazon ElastiCache for Redis is fully managed,
                  scalable, and secure. This makes it an ideal candidate to power high-performance use cases such as
                  web, mobile apps, gaming, ad-tech, and IoT.</li><br>
                  <li>Memcached - a widely adopted memory object caching system. Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached
                  is protocol compliant with Memcached, so popular too
